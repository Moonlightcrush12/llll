We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning. Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.

COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19. According to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.[1] However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled.>

                        <p> I really want to make an important point before commencing this review: this score and review are an honest appraisal, whether there had been a global coronavirus pandemic or not.
I've seen this movie about seven times. My first viewing was just after it was released, way before this current pandemic. 

It's a great film, in my opinion it's Steven Soderbergh's best; his methods of shooting scenes and editing between takes, in-camera so to speak, I find quite astonishing but efficiently brilliant. As long as he picks the right story in the first place it will be made into a great movie  in his hands. 
and this is a great story. 
The castings are second to none; everyone suits their roles and the acting is solid; it's all highly convincing. 

The fact there has been a fatal pandemic has of course made this film absolutely, incredibly more relevant than ever. 
For a film that's now ten years old, it jumped back into the top three of most watched films on Netflix. That's pretty incredible.  But what's more incredible is how people clearly don't pay attention:
Steven Soderbergh basically laid it all out for us ten years ago,  made a great film that said this is what could happen. 
and, as a species,  we have dealt with it like chimpanzees, frankly.</p>

                <p>This new age pandemic has shown us that all of us have to bow towards Mother Nature. Like our Honorable PM said, “This virus sees no race, religion, caste, creed or sex.” It has affected the world globally irrespective of whether we are rich or poor. Global warming, rapid industrialization, deforestation, loss of natural habitat, increased stress of new age living have all contributed to what we are facing now. This book attempts to delve into some of the contributory factors that lead to the issues the world is facing right now and some of the latest methods of treatment and the need for global solidarity.</p>
